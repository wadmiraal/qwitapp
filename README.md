Qwit :: Helps you quit
======================

Qwit is a small, browser application that helps you get rid of nasty habits, like smoking, drinking, or sending your relatives silly cat memes.

The basic idea is simple: just keep track of your daily progress. For every day you stay strong, you click the happy face; for all the other days, you click the sad face. You can see your progress, see your longest *streak*, etc. Of course, Qwit offers no guarantee what so ever concerning your success. Sometimes sheer will power and motivation is not enough and professional help is necessary.

You can find more information on the [website]().
