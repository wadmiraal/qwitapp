Qwit :: Helps you quit
======================

Qwit is a small, browser application that helps you get rid of nasty habits, like smoking, drinking, or sending your relatives silly cat memes.

The basic idea is simple: just keep track of your daily progress. For every day you stay strong, you click the happy face; for all the other days, you click the sad face. You can see your progress, see your longest *streak*, etc. Of course, Qwit offers no guarantee what so ever concerning your success. Sometimes sheer will power and motivation is not enough and professional help is necessary.
